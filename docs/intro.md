# Introduction

The SadBoat Engine is an open source, free to use software primarily for video game development. It's original design is made to accommodate heavy multithreading and parallel processed graphics through Vulkan. When combined with the efficiency of low level code like C++, this structure is intended to allow for intensive games, such as physics simulators, to run in real time. 

We've attempted to make our engine object oriented and not terribly difficult to use. This being said, however, there can be a steep learning curve with more complicated programming features like multithreading and computer graphics. These documents are intended to be an aid on your journey to learn these tools.

## Organization

We've organized our document into a few smaller segments.  
- **Chapters:**   Feature Categories
- **Pages:**      Feature Descriptions
- **Page Sections:**  Feature Clarifications.

### Chapters
- 1: Introduction
- 2: Utilities
- 3: Primitives
- 4: Events
- 5: Physics
- 6: Rendering

More chapters will be written as engine development progresses.


### Page Sections
-   Prototype  
-   Usage: Basic  
-   Usage: Advanced  
-   Implementation  
-   Extra Resources  

#### Prototype
> 
> A short code block detailing what the feature's declaration may look like, what parameters the feature takes, and the feature's general structure.
> Provides no implementation details or usage clarification; just code definitions.
> 

#### Usage: Basic
> 
> A short description detailing what the feature's intended use case is, possible uses for the feature, and possible examples.
> Limited technical details in order to provide a basic understanding of the feature.
> 
#### Usage: Advanced
> 
> A longer technical description detailing possible extended uses of the feature. May not include examples, but proposes usage more advanced projects.
> General technical details in order to broaden the scope of previous passages.
> 
#### Implementation
> 
> A technical document giving exact terminology as per how the feature works. Examples will be provided as links to source code.
> Is limited to *only* technical details.
> 
#### Extra Resources
> 
> Other content that may be useful alongside this feature; documentation on it's implementation, links to other chapters that use the feature.
>
