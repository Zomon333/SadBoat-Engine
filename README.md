# SadBoat-Engine
A basic physics and rendering engine built in C++ for SadBoat.

**Introduction**
>This is a rather simple open source game engine, built to house games we intend to work on. Features will be added to support these games, and overrides will be provided to allow increased flexibility to the end user. 
>The SadBoat engine is built using Vulkan, some self-made physics & collisions, and a lot of effort.
